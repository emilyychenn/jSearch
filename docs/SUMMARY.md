Our project allows users to track job applications for a given requirement cycle, as desired. There's a page for each table in our database that allows users to add, modify, and delete rows. In addition, we have a custom "insights" page that allows users to perform more interesting queries. These include...

* Determine all jobs with compensation above some minimum threshold, to demonstrate selection
* Select a give column from the applicant table (e.g., only applicant names), to demonstrate projection
* Determine a specialization from an applicant's email address, to demonstrate a join
* Determine the number of universities in the database, to demonstrate aggregation
* Determine the number of applicants per job position, to demonstrate nested aggregation
* Determine the job positions that _all_ applicants applied to, to demonstrate division
